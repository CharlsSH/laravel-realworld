This Laravel app is part of the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) project.

See how the exact same Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io)) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because **they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://gothinkster.github.io/realworld/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction)**
